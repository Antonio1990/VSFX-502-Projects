			<P>
			Cutter was originally intended to be a RenderMan text editor that
			would enable users to conveniently create, edit, render and compile 
			rib documents and shading language source code files. Since its
			introduction in 2001 I have added many "RenderMan savvy" features 
			to Cutter to ensure it is a self contained environment.
			<BR>
			<BR>
			In addition to being tightly coupled to RenderMan it has also evolved
			into a useful text editor for a number of other scripting and 
			programing languages such as Tcl, Mel, Python, Vfl, Ifd, Html, Shake,
			C, CPP and Java.<BR>
			<BR>
			<B>Integrated Browser</B><BR>
			Cutter can automatically display an appropriate web page from the online 
			documentation supplied by Pixar, Alias|Wavefront and ActiveState using 
			either its own internal browser or Internet Exployer. For example when 
			editing a (Pixar) shading language document, option + double clicking on the 
			name of function, say, <B>xcomp</B>()
			<BR> 
			<BR>
			<IMG SRC="xcomp.gif" ALT="">
			<BR>
			<BR>
			<P>
			will cause Cutter to open its internal browser at
			</P>
<PRE>RISpec-html/section15.html#Geometric.functions</PRE>
			<IMG SRC="browser_xcomp.gif" ALT=""><BR><BR>
			
			<P>
			Or option + double clicking on a datatype, such as <B>float</B>, will likewise cause the browser to open,
			</P>
<PRE>shading_language_extensions/slextensions.html#Variable_Types</PRE>
			<P>
			Some online documents will not display properly in Cutter's internal
			browser - Shake documentation is particularly difficult to read. Holding 
			down the shift key while option + double clicking will display
			the appropriate document with <B>Internet Exployer</B> or (Mac OSX) <B>Safari</B>.<BR>
			<BR>
			<B>Popup Menu's</B><BR>
			With the exception of HTML and MEL scripts, all other script documents 
			have access to a popup menu that can be displayed in the normal way ie. right
			mouse click for Windows and Linux or Control + mouse click on Mac OSX.
			Two examples are shown below.

			<P>
			In the case of Mel scripts, Cutter goes one very useful step further
			by providing popups that display a summarized version of the information about a
			specific Mel command. For example,
			invoking the popup for "dynExpression" yields a list of its flags, sorted
			alphabetically, along with the descriptions of each flag extracted from
			the Alias|Wavefront online docs. 
			</P>
			<BR>
			<P align=middle>
			<img src="mel_popup.gif" ALT="mel_popup">

			Like MEL the popup for a HTML document is also customized. The popup
			for a HTML document is shown below.

			<B>Execute</B><BR>
			When a supported script document is open in Cutter it can be
			"executed" by using the menu bar command, Tool > Execute, or ctrl + E, 
			or option + E or Apple + E (Max OS X) or, finally, via the last item in
			the popup menu. The following example shows a 
			"Process Info" window displaying the output from a simple Tcl script.

			<P>
			Notice in the lower righthand corner of the "demo.tcl" script window
			the item "History 1 of 1". Each time a supported script document is 
			"executed" a copy of the script is added to a history zip file. The
			history file for demo.tcl would be automatically saved in the same 
			directory as the source file as "cutter_history/demo.zip".
			<BR>
			<BR>
			The history window for demo.tcl can be opened either from the main
			menu bar History > Open History or by pressing ctrl + H, or option + H.
			Navigation buttons at the top of the history window allow previous 
			versions of a script to be viewed as well as executed. Below we see
			version 2 of 3 has been re-executed.

			The facility to execute a script is different for Mel. Cutter can
			execute a Mel script by ftp'ing it to a Maya session that is either
			running on the same computer or across a network to another computer.
			Assume Maya has been launched on a computer with an IP address of
			10.7.101.48 and that it has been told to "listen" for connections on
			port 2222 (any unused port will work) as a result of entering the 
			following Mel command in the Maya script window,
			</P>
<PRE>commandPort -n ":2222"</PRE>	
			<P>
			A trivial Mel script is shown below. The network icon on the righthand 
			side of its window has been selected and the window "Mode" has been set to
			"Maya". The "connect to IP:" and "port:" text fields have been chosen to
			match the IP address of the destination computer on which Maya is
			running.

			Unfortunately, commandPort does not work on 
			"Maya Complete", therefore, this facility is unavailable on
			the Mac OS X version.
