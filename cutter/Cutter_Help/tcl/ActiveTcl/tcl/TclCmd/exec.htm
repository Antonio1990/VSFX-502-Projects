<h3><a name="M2">NAME</a></h3>

<p>exec - Invoke subprocess(es)</p>

<h3><a name="M3">SYNOPSIS</a></h3>

<p><b>exec</b> ?<i>switches</i>? <i>arg</i> ?<i>arg ...</i>?<br>
</p>

<h3><a name="M4">DESCRIPTION</a></h3>

<p>This command treats its arguments as the specification of one or
more subprocesses to execute. The arguments take the form of a
standard shell pipeline where each <i>arg</i> becomes one word of a
command, and each distinct command becomes a subprocess.</p>

<p>If the initial arguments to <b>exec</b> start with <b>-</b> then
they are treated as command-line switches and are not part of the
pipeline specification. The following switches are currently
supported:</p>

<dl>
<dt><a name="M5"><b>-keepnewline</b></a></dt>

<dd>Retains a trailing newline in the pipeline's output. Normally a
trailing newline will be deleted.</dd>

<dt><a name="M6"><b>-&nbsp;-</b></a></dt>

<dd>Marks the end of switches. The argument following this one will
be treated as the first <i>arg</i> even if it starts with a
<b>-</b>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>If an <i>arg</i> (or pair of <i>arg</i>'s) has one of the forms
described below then it is used by <b>exec</b> to control the flow
of input and output among the subprocess(es). Such arguments will
not be passed to the subprocess(es). In forms such as ``&lt;
<i>fileName</i>'' <i>fileName</i> may either be in a separate
argument from ``&lt;'' or in the same argument with no intervening
space (i.e. ``&lt;<i>fileName</i>'').</p>

<dl>
<dt><a name="M7">|</a></dt>

<dd>Separates distinct commands in the pipeline. The standard
output of the preceding command will be piped into the standard
input of the next command.</dd>

<dt><a name="M8">|&amp;</a></dt>

<dd>Separates distinct commands in the pipeline. Both standard
output and standard error of the preceding command will be piped
into the standard input of the next command. This form of
redirection overrides forms such as 2&gt; and &gt;&amp;.</dd>

<dt><a name="M9">&lt; <i>fileName</i></a></dt>

<dd>The file named by <i>fileName</i> is opened and used as the
standard input for the first command in the pipeline.</dd>

<dt><a name="M10">&lt;@ <i>fileId</i></a></dt>

<dd><i>FileId</i> must be the identifier for an open file, such as
the return value from a previous call to <b><a href=
"../TclCmd/open.htm">open</a></b>. It is used as the standard input
for the first command in the pipeline. <i>FileId</i> must have been
opened for reading.</dd>

<dt><a name="M11">&lt;&lt; <i>value</i></a></dt>

<dd><i>Value</i> is passed to the first command as its standard
input.</dd>

<dt><a name="M12">&gt; <i>fileName</i></a></dt>

<dd>Standard output from the last command is redirected to the file
named <i>fileName</i>, overwriting its previous contents.</dd>

<dt><a name="M13">2&gt; <i>fileName</i></a></dt>

<dd>Standard error from all commands in the pipeline is redirected
to the file named <i>fileName</i>, overwriting its previous
contents.</dd>

<dt><a name="M14">&gt;&amp; <i>fileName</i></a></dt>

<dd>Both standard output from the last command and standard error
from all commands are redirected to the file named <i>fileName</i>,
overwriting its previous contents.</dd>

<dt><a name="M15">&gt;&gt; <i>fileName</i></a></dt>

<dd>Standard output from the last command is redirected to the file
named <i>fileName</i>, appending to it rather than overwriting
it.</dd>

<dt><a name="M16">2&gt;&gt; <i>fileName</i></a></dt>

<dd>Standard error from all commands in the pipeline is redirected
to the file named <i>fileName</i>, appending to it rather than
overwriting it.</dd>

<dt><a name="M17">&gt;&gt;&amp; <i>fileName</i></a></dt>

<dd>Both standard output from the last command and standard error
from all commands are redirected to the file named <i>fileName</i>,
appending to it rather than overwriting it.</dd>

<dt><a name="M18">&gt;@ <i>fileId</i></a></dt>

<dd><i>FileId</i> must be the identifier for an open file, such as
the return value from a previous call to <b><a href=
"../TclCmd/open.htm">open</a></b>. Standard output from the last
command is redirected to <i>fileId</i>'s file, which must have been
opened for writing.</dd>

<dt><a name="M19">2&gt;@ <i>fileId</i></a></dt>

<dd><i>FileId</i> must be the identifier for an open file, such as
the return value from a previous call to <b><a href=
"../TclCmd/open.htm">open</a></b>. Standard error from all commands
in the pipeline is redirected to <i>fileId</i>'s file. The file
must have been opened for writing.</dd>

<dt><a name="M20">&gt;&amp;@ <i>fileId</i></a></dt>

<dd><i>FileId</i> must be the identifier for an open file, such as
the return value from a previous call to <b><a href=
"../TclCmd/open.htm">open</a></b>. Both standard output from the
last command and standard error from all commands are redirected to
<i>fileId</i>'s file. The file must have been opened for
writing.</dd>
</dl>

<p>If standard output has not been redirected then the <b>exec</b>
command returns the standard output from the last command in the
pipeline. If any of the commands in the pipeline exit abnormally or
are killed or suspended, then <b>exec</b> will return an error and
the error message will include the pipeline's output followed by
error messages describing the abnormal terminations; the
<b>errorCode</b> variable will contain additional information about
the last abnormal termination encountered. If any of the commands
writes to its standard error file and that standard error isn't
redirected, then <b>exec</b> will return an error; the error
message will include the pipeline's standard output, followed by
messages about abnormal terminations (if any), followed by the
standard error output.</p>

<p>If the last character of the result or error message is a
newline then that character is normally deleted from the result or
error message. This is consistent with other Tcl return values,
which don't normally end with newlines. However, if
<b>-keepnewline</b> is specified then the trailing newline is
retained.</p>

<p>If standard input isn't redirected with ``&lt;'' or ``&lt;&lt;''
or ``&lt;@'' then the standard input for the first command in the
pipeline is taken from the application's current standard
input.</p>

<p>If the last <i>arg</i> is ``&amp;'' then the pipeline will be
executed in background. In this case the <b>exec</b> command will
return a list whose elements are the process identifiers for all of
the subprocesses in the pipeline. The standard output from the last
command in the pipeline will go to the application's standard
output if it hasn't been redirected, and error output from all of
the commands in the pipeline will go to the application's standard
error file unless redirected.</p>

<p>The first word in each command is taken as the command name;
tilde-substitution is performed on it, and if the result contains
no slashes then the directories in the PATH environment variable
are searched for an executable by the given name. If the name
contains a slash then it must refer to an executable reachable from
the current directory. No ``<a href="../TclCmd/glob.htm">glob</a>''
expansion or other shell-like substitutions are performed on the
arguments to commands.</p>

<h3><a name="M21">PORTABILITY ISSUES</a></h3>

<dl>
<dt><a name="M22"><b>Windows</b> (all versions)</a></dt>

<dd>Reading from or writing to a socket, using the ``<b>@</b>
<i>fileId</i>'' notation, does not work. When reading from a
socket, a 16-bit DOS application will hang and a 32-bit application
will return immediately with end-of-file. When either type of
application writes to a socket, the information is instead sent to
the console, if one is present, or is discarded. 

<p>The Tk console text widget does not provide real standard IO
capabilities. Under Tk, when redirecting from standard input, all
applications will see an immediate end-of-file; information
redirected to standard output or standard error will be
discarded.</p>

<p>Either forward or backward slashes are accepted as path
separators for arguments to Tcl commands. When executing an
application, the path name specified for the application may also
contain forward or backward slashes as path separators. Bear in
mind, however, that most Windows applications accept arguments with
forward slashes only as option delimiters and backslashes only in
paths. Any arguments to an application that specify a path name
with forward slashes will not automatically be converted to use the
backslash character. If an argument contains forward slashes as the
path separator, it may or may not be recognized as a path name,
depending on the program.</p>

<p>Additionally, when calling a 16-bit DOS or Windows 3.X
application, all path names must use the short, cryptic, path
format (e.g., using ``applba~1.def'' instead of
``applbakery.default''), which can be obtained with the <b>file
attributes $fileName -shortname</b> command.</p>

<p>Two or more forward or backward slashes in a row in a path refer
to a network path. For example, a simple concatenation of the root
directory <b>c:/</b> with a subdirectory <b>/windows/system</b>
will yield <b>c://windows/system</b> (two slashes together), which
refers to the mount point called <b>system</b> on the machine
called <b>windows</b> (and the <b>c:/</b> is ignored), and is not
equivalent to <b>c:/windows/system</b>, which describes a directory
on the current computer. The <b><a href="../TclCmd/file.htm">file
join</a></b> command should be used to concatenate path
components.</p>

<dl>
<dd>Note that there are two general types of Win32 console
applications: 

<dl>
<dd>1) CLI -- CommandLine Interface, simple stdio exchange.
<b>netstat.exe</b> for example.<br>
2) TUI -- Textmode User Interface, any application that accesses
the console API for doing such things as cursor movement, setting
text color, detecting key presses and mouse movement, etc... An
example would be <b>telnet.exe</b> from Windows 2000. These types
of applications are not common in a windows environment, but do
exist.</dd>
</dl>

<b>exec</b> will not work well with TUI applications when a console
is not present, as is done when launching applications under wish.
It is desirable to have console applications hidden and detached.
This is a designed-in limitation as <b>exec</b> wants to
communicate over pipes. The Expect extension addresses this issue
when communication between a TUI application is desired.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dt><a name="M23"><b>Windows NT</b></a></dt>

<dd>When attempting to execute an application, <b>exec</b> first
searches for the name as it was specified. Then, in order,
<b>.com</b>, <b>.exe</b>, and <b>.bat</b> are appended to the end
of the specified name and it searches for the longer name. If a
directory name was not specified as part of the application name,
the following directories are automatically searched in order when
attempting to locate the application: 

<dl>
<dd>The directory from which the Tcl executable was loaded.<br>
The current directory.<br>
The Windows NT 32-bit system directory.<br>
The Windows NT 16-bit system directory.<br>
The Windows NT home directory.<br>
The directories listed in the path.</dd>
</dl>

<p>In order to execute the shell builtin commands like <b>dir</b>
and <b>copy</b>, the caller must prepend ``<b>cmd.exe /c</b> '' to
the desired command.</p>
</dd>

<dt><a name="M24"><b>Windows 95</b></a></dt>

<dd>When attempting to execute an application, <b>exec</b> first
searches for the name as it was specified. Then, in order,
<b>.com</b>, <b>.exe</b>, and <b>.bat</b> are appended to the end
of the specified name and it searches for the longer name. If a
directory name was not specified as part of the application name,
the following directories are automatically searched in order when
attempting to locate the application: 

<dl>
<dd>The directory from which the Tcl executable was loaded.<br>
The current directory.<br>
The Windows 95 system directory.<br>
The Windows 95 home directory.<br>
The directories listed in the path.</dd>
</dl>

<p>In order to execute the shell builtin commands like <b>dir</b>
and <b>copy</b>, the caller must prepend ``<b>command.com /c</b> ''
to the desired command.</p>

<p>Once a 16-bit DOS application has read standard input from a
console and then quit, all subsequently run 16-bit DOS applications
will see the standard input as already closed. 32-bit applications
do not have this problem and will run correctly, even after a
16-bit DOS application thinks that standard input is closed. There
is no known workaround for this bug at this time.</p>

<p>Redirection between the <b>NUL:</b> device and a 16-bit
application does not always work. When redirecting from
<b>NUL:</b>, some applications may hang, others will get an
infinite stream of ``0x01'' bytes, and some will actually correctly
get an immediate end-of-file; the behavior seems to depend upon
something compiled into the application itself. When redirecting
greater than 4K or so to <b>NUL:</b>, some applications will hang.
The above problems do not happen with 32-bit applications.</p>

<p>All DOS 16-bit applications are run synchronously. All standard
input from a pipe to a 16-bit DOS application is collected into a
temporary file; the other end of the pipe must be closed before the
16-bit DOS application begins executing. All standard output or
error from a 16-bit DOS application to a pipe is collected into
temporary files; the application must terminate before the
temporary files are redirected to the next stage of the pipeline.
This is due to a workaround for a Windows 95 bug in the
implementation of pipes, and is how the standard Windows 95 DOS
shell handles pipes itself.</p>

<p>Certain applications, such as <b>command.com</b>, should not be
executed interactively. Applications which directly access the
console window, rather than reading from their standard input and
writing to their standard output may fail, hang Tcl, or even hang
the system if their own private console window is not available to
them.</p>
