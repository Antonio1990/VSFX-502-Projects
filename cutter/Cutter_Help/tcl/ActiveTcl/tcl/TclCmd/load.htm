<p>load - Load machine code and initialize new commands.</p>

<h3><a name="M3">SYNOPSIS</a></h3>

<p><b>load</b> <i>fileName</i><br>
<b>load</b> <i>fileName packageName</i><br>
<b>load</b> <i>fileName packageName interp</i><br>
</p>

<h3><a name="M4">DESCRIPTION</a></h3>

<p>This command loads binary code from a file into the
application's address space and calls an initialization procedure
in the package to incorporate it into an interpreter.
<i>fileName</i> is the name of the file containing the code; its
exact form varies from system to system but on most systems it is a
shared library, such as a <b>.so</b> file under Solaris or a DLL
under Windows. <i>packageName</i> is the name of the package, and
is used to compute the name of an initialization procedure.
<i>interp</i> is the path name of the interpreter into which to
load the package (see the <b><a href=
"../TclCmd/interp.htm">interp</a></b> manual entry for details); if
<i>interp</i> is omitted, it defaults to the interpreter in which
the <b>load</b> command was invoked.</p>

<p>Once the file has been loaded into the application's address
space, one of two initialization procedures will be invoked in the
new code. Typically the initialization procedure will add new
commands to a Tcl interpreter. The name of the initialization
procedure is determined by <i>packageName</i> and whether or not
the target interpreter is a safe one. For normal interpreters the
name of the initialization procedure will have the form
<i>pkg</i><b>_Init</b>, where <i>pkg</i> is the same as
<i>packageName</i> except that the first letter is converted to
upper case and all other letters are converted to lower case. For
example, if <i>packageName</i> is <b>foo</b> or <b>FOo</b>, the
initialization procedure's name will be <b>Foo_Init</b>.</p>

<p>If the target interpreter is a safe interpreter, then the name
of the initialization procedure will be <i>pkg</i><b>_SafeInit</b>
instead of <i>pkg</i><b>_Init</b>. The <i>pkg</i><b>_SafeInit</b>
function should be written carefully, so that it initializes the
safe interpreter only with partial functionality provided by the
package that is safe for use by untrusted code. For more
information on Safe-Tcl, see the <b>safe</b> manual entry.</p>

<p>The initialization procedure must match the following
prototype:</p>

<pre>
typedef int Tcl_PackageInitProc(<a href=
"../TclLib/Interp.htm">Tcl_Interp</a> *<i>interp</i>);
</pre>

<p>The <i>interp</i> argument identifies the interpreter in which
the package is to be loaded. The initialization procedure must
return <b>TCL_OK</b> or <b>TCL_ERROR</b> to indicate whether or not
it completed successfully; in the event of an error it should set
the interpreter's result to point to an error message. The result
of the <b>load</b> command will be the result returned by the
initialization procedure.</p>

<p>The actual loading of a file will only be done once for each
<i>fileName</i> in an application. If a given <i>fileName</i> is
loaded into multiple interpreters, then the first <b>load</b> will
load the code and call the initialization procedure; subsequent
<b>load</b>s will call the initialization procedure without loading
the code again. It is not possible to unload or reload a
package.</p>

<p>The <b>load</b> command also supports packages that are
statically linked with the application, if those packages have been
registered by calling the <b><a href=
"../TclLib/StaticPkg.htm">Tcl_StaticPackage</a></b> procedure. If
<i>fileName</i> is an empty string, then <i>packageName</i> must be
specified.</p>

<p>If <i>packageName</i> is omitted or specified as an empty
string, Tcl tries to guess the name of the package. This may be
done differently on different platforms. The default guess, which
is used on most UNIX platforms, is to take the last element of
<i>fileName</i>, strip off the first three characters if they are
<b>lib</b>, and use any following alphabetic and underline
characters as the module name. For example, the command <b>load
libxyz4.2.so</b> uses the module name <b>xyz</b> and the command
<b>load bin/last.so {}</b> uses the module name <b>last</b>.</p>

<p>If <i>fileName</i> is an empty string, then <i>packageName</i>
must be specified. The <b>load</b> command first searches for a
statically loaded package (one that has been registered by calling
the <b><a href="../TclLib/StaticPkg.htm">Tcl_StaticPackage</a></b>
procedure) by that name; if one is found, it is used. Otherwise,
the <b>load</b> command searches for a dynamically loaded package
by that name, and uses it if it is found. If several different
files have been <b>load</b>ed with different versions of the
package, Tcl picks the file that was loaded first.</p>

<dt><a name="M6"><b>Windows</b></a></dt>

<dd>When a load fails with "library not found" error, it is also
possible that a dependent library was not found. To see the
dependent libraries, type ``dumpbin -imports &lt;dllname&gt;'' in a
DOS console to see what the library must import. When loading a DLL
in the current directory, Windows will ignore ``./'' as a path
specifier and use a search heuristic to find the DLL instead. To
avoid this, load the DLL with 

<pre>
load [file join [pwd] mylib.DLL]
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>

<h3><a name="M7">BUGS</a></h3>

<p>If the same file is <b>load</b>ed by different <i>fileName</i>s,
it will be loaded into the process's address space multiple times.
The behavior of this varies from system to system (some systems may
detect the redundant loads, others may not).</p>
