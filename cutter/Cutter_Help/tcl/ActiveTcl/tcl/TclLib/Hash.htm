<h3><a name="M5">DESCRIPTION</a></h3>

<p>A hash table consists of zero or more entries, each consisting
of a key and a value. Given the key for an entry, the hashing
routines can very quickly locate the entry, and hence its value.
There may be at most one entry in a hash table with a particular
key, but many entries may have the same value. Keys can take one of
four forms: strings, one-word values, integer arrays, or custom
keys defined by a Tcl_HashKeyType structure (See section <b>THE
TCL_HASHKEYTYPE STRUCTURE</b> below). All of the keys in a given
table have the same form, which is specified when the table is
initialized.</p>

<p>The value of a hash table entry can be anything that fits in the
same space as a ``char *'' pointer. Values for hash table entries
are managed entirely by clients, not by the hash module itself.
Typically each entry's value is a pointer to a data structure
managed by client code.</p>

<p>Hash tables grow gracefully as the number of entries increases,
so that there are always less than three entries per hash bucket,
on average. This allows for fast lookups regardless of the number
of entries in a table.</p>

<p>The core provides three functions for the initialization of hash
tables, Tcl_InitHashTable, Tcl_InitObjHashTable and
Tcl_InitCustomHashTable.</p>

<p><b>Tcl_InitHashTable</b> initializes a structure that describes
a new hash table. The space for the structure is provided by the
caller, not by the hash module. The value of <i>keyType</i>
indicates what kinds of keys will be used for all entries in the
table. All of the key types described later are allowed, with the
exception of <b>TCL_CUSTOM_TYPE_KEYS</b> and
<b>TCL_CUSTOM_PTR_KEYS</b>.</p>

<p><b>Tcl_InitObjHashTable</b> is a wrapper around
<b>Tcl_InitCustomHashTable</b> and initializes a hash table whose
keys are Tcl_Obj *.</p>

<p><b>Tcl_InitCustomHashTable</b> initializes a structure that
describes a new hash table. The space for the structure is provided
by the caller, not by the hash module. The value of <i>keyType</i>
indicates what kinds of keys will be used for all entries in the
table. <i>KeyType</i> must have one of the following values:</p>

<dl>
<dt><a name="M6"><b>TCL_STRING_KEYS</b></a></dt>

<dd>Keys are null-terminated ASCII strings. They are passed to
hashing routines using the address of the first character of the
string.</dd>

<dt><a name="M7"><b>TCL_ONE_WORD_KEYS</b></a></dt>

<dd>Keys are single-word values; they are passed to hashing
routines and stored in hash table entries as ``char *'' values. The
pointer value is the key; it need not (and usually doesn't)
actually point to a string.</dd>

<dt><a name="M8"><b>TCL_CUSTOM_TYPE_KEYS</b></a></dt>

<dd>Keys are of arbitrary type, and are stored in the entry.
Hashing and comparison is determined by <i>typePtr</i>. The
Tcl_HashKeyType structure is described in the section <b>THE
TCL_HASHKEYTYPE STRUCTURE</b> below.</dd>

<dt><a name="M9"><b>TCL_CUSTOM_PTR_KEYS</b></a></dt>

<dd>Keys are pointers to an arbitrary type, and are stored in the
entry. Hashing and comparison is determined by <i>typePtr</i>. The
Tcl_HashKeyType structure is described in the section <b>THE
TCL_HASHKEYTYPE STRUCTURE</b> below.</dd>

<dt><a name="M10"><i>other</i></a></dt>

<dd>If <i>keyType</i> is not one of the above, then it must be an
integer value greater than 1. In this case the keys will be arrays
of ``int'' values, where <i>keyType</i> gives the number of ints in
each key. This allows structures to be used as keys. All keys must
have the same size. Array keys are passed into hashing functions
using the address of the first int in the array.</dd>
</dl>

<p><b>Tcl_DeleteHashTable</b> deletes all of the entries in a hash
table and frees up the memory associated with the table's bucket
array and entries. It does not free the actual table structure
(pointed to by <i>tablePtr</i>), since that memory is assumed to be
managed by the client. <b>Tcl_DeleteHashTable</b> also does not
free or otherwise manipulate the values of the hash table entries.
If the entry values point to dynamically-allocated memory, then it
is the client's responsibility to free these structures before
deleting the table.</p>

<p><b>Tcl_CreateHashEntry</b> locates the entry corresponding to a
particular key, creating a new entry in the table if there wasn't
already one with the given key. If an entry already existed with
the given key then <i>*newPtr</i> is set to zero. If a new entry
was created, then <i>*newPtr</i> is set to a non-zero value and the
value of the new entry will be set to zero. The return value from
<b>Tcl_CreateHashEntry</b> is a pointer to the entry, which may be
used to retrieve and modify the entry's value or to delete the
entry from the table.</p>

<p><b>Tcl_DeleteHashEntry</b> will remove an existing entry from a
table. The memory associated with the entry itself will be freed,
but the client is responsible for any cleanup associated with the
entry's value, such as freeing a structure that it points to.</p>

<p><b>Tcl_FindHashEntry</b> is similar to
<b>Tcl_CreateHashEntry</b> except that it doesn't create a new
entry if the key doesn't exist; instead, it returns NULL as
result.</p>

<p><b>Tcl_GetHashValue</b> and <b>Tcl_SetHashValue</b> are used to
read and write an entry's value, respectively. Values are stored
and retrieved as type ``ClientData'', which is large enough to hold
a pointer value. On almost all machines this is large enough to
hold an integer value too.</p>

<p><b>Tcl_GetHashKey</b> returns the key for a given hash table
entry, either as a pointer to a string, a one-word (``char *'')
key, or as a pointer to the first word of an array of integers,
depending on the <i>keyType</i> used to create a hash table. In all
cases <b>Tcl_GetHashKey</b> returns a result with type ``char *''.
When the key is a string or array, the result of
<b>Tcl_GetHashKey</b> points to information in the table entry;
this information will remain valid until the entry is deleted or
its table is deleted.</p>

<p><b>Tcl_FirstHashEntry</b> and <b>Tcl_NextHashEntry</b> may be
used to scan all of the entries in a hash table. A structure of
type ``Tcl_HashSearch'', provided by the client, is used to keep
track of progress through the table. <b>Tcl_FirstHashEntry</b>
initializes the search record and returns the first entry in the
table (or NULL if the table is empty). Each subsequent call to
<b>Tcl_NextHashEntry</b> returns the next entry in the table or
NULL if the end of the table has been reached. A call to
<b>Tcl_FirstHashEntry</b> followed by calls to
<b>Tcl_NextHashEntry</b> will return each of the entries in the
table exactly once, in an arbitrary order. It is unadvisable to
modify the structure of the table, e.g. by creating or deleting
entries, while the search is in progress.</p>

<p><b>Tcl_HashStats</b> returns a dynamically-allocated string with
overall information about a hash table, such as the number of
entries it contains, the number of buckets in its hash array, and
the utilization of the buckets. It is the caller's responsibility
to free the result string by passing it to <b><a href=
"../TclLib/Alloc.htm">ckfree</a></b>.</p>

<p>The header file <b>tcl.h</b> defines the actual data structures
used to implement hash tables. This is necessary so that clients
can allocate Tcl_HashTable structures and so that macros can be
used to read and write the values of entries. However, users of the
hashing routines should never refer directly to any of the fields
of any of the hash-related data structures; use the procedures and
macros defined here.</p>

<h3><a name="M11">THE TCL_HASHKEYTYPE STRUCTURE</a></h3>

<p>Extension writers can define new hash key types by defining four
procedures, initializing a Tcl_HashKeyType structure to describe
the type, and calling <b>Tcl_InitCustomHashTable</b>. The
<b>Tcl_HashKeyType</b> structure is defined as follows:</p>

<pre>
typedef struct Tcl_HashKeyType {
    int <i>version</i>;
    int <i>flags</i>;
    Tcl_HashKeyProc *<i>hashKeyProc</i>;
    Tcl_CompareHashKeysProc *<i>compareKeysProc</i>;
    Tcl_AllocHashEntryProc *<i>allocEntryProc</i>;
    Tcl_FreeHashEntryProc *<i>freeEntryProc</i>;
} Tcl_HashKeyType;
</pre>

<p>The <i>version</i> member is the version of the table. If this
structure is extended in future then the version can be used to
distinguish between different structures. It should be set to
<b>TCL_HASH_KEY_TYPE_VERSION</b>.</p>

<p>The <i>flags</i> member is one or more of the following values
OR'ed together:</p>

<dl>
<dt><a name="M12"><b>TCL_HASH_KEY_RANDOMIZE_HASH</b></a></dt>

<dd>There are some things, pointers for example which don't hash
well because they do not use the lower bits. If this flag is set
then the hash table will attempt to rectify this by randomising the
bits and then using the upper N bits as the index into the
table.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The <i>hashKeyProc</i> member contains the address of a function
called to calculate a hash value for the key.</p>

<pre>
typedef unsigned int (Tcl_HashKeyProc) (
    Tcl_HashTable *<i>tablePtr</i>,
    VOID *<i>keyPtr</i>);
</pre>

<p>If this is NULL then <i>keyPtr</i> is used and
<b>TCL_HASH_KEY_RANDOMIZE_HASH</b> is assumed.</p>

<p>The <i>compareKeysProc</i> member contains the address of a
function called to compare two keys.</p>

<pre>
typedef int (Tcl_CompareHashKeysProc) (VOID *<i>keyPtr</i>,
    Tcl_HashEntry *<i>hPtr</i>);
</pre>

<p>If this is NULL then the <i>keyPtr</i> pointers are compared. If
the keys don't match then the function returns 0, otherwise it
returns 1.</p>

<p>The <i>allocEntryProc</i> member contains the address of a
function called to allocate space for an entry and initialise the
key.</p>

<pre>
typedef Tcl_HashEntry *(Tcl_AllocHashEntryProc) (
    Tcl_HashTable *<i>tablePtr</i>, VOID *<i>keyPtr</i>);
</pre>

<p>If this is NULL then <a href="../TclLib/Alloc.htm">Tcl_Alloc</a>
is used to allocate enough space for a Tcl_HashEntry and the key
pointer is assigned to key.oneWordValue. String keys and array keys
use this function to allocate enough space for the entry and the
key in one block, rather than doing it in two blocks. This saves
space for a pointer to the key from the entry and another memory
allocation. Tcl_Obj * keys use this function to allocate enough
space for an entry and increment the reference count on the object.
If</p>

<p>The <i>freeEntryProc</i> member contains the address of a
function called to free space for an entry.</p>

<pre>
typedef void (Tcl_FreeHashEntryProc) (Tcl_HashEntry *<i>hPtr</i>);
</pre>

<p>If this is NULL then <a href="../TclLib/Alloc.htm">Tcl_Free</a>
is used to free the space for the entry. Tcl_Obj * keys use this
function to decrement the reference count on the object.</p>
